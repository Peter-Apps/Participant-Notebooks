Studing the pattern of pulse arrivals times is called timing the pulsar and can provide information about the pulsar like the spin period, the type of pulsar, the age of the pulsar and if it has a binary companion. One of the things that can alter the observed time between pulses (the spin period) is when a pulsar has a binary companion. As the pulsar orbits, the observed period will change depending on if the pulsar is moving towards or away from you. If the pulsar is moving towards you, the observed period will be shorter, if it is moving away the observed period will be longer (see Figure 1). You may remember learning about the Doppler effect in class. You can think about the pulses like the crests of the wave. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdiHmSWI2Ks) if you want to review the Doppler effect.\n","\n","Pulsar timing is a complex process. In this activity we are simplifying the process but looking at the daily observed period returned by the software of the 20 m telescope rather than looking at the raw data. If you want to learn more about pulsar timing, you can read [this](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/PulsarTiming.html).
