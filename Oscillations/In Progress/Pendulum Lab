My current school is a Title I school where I teach students with a broad range of abilities. If I change schools, I may be working at a place with much more advanced students. This implementation plan is geared toward the latter case, but could completely change in the fall.\n","\n","In an ideal world, I would integrate Python into labs throughout the year. As opposed to teaching Python as a seperate skill, I would try to add a little bit progressively with each lab. I compare this to the way I best learned math. When math was presented to me all at once with no context, I struggled. When it was mixed in throughout the year in a physics course, I just viewed it as a tool to understand something I was interested in, and it didn't feel like work.\n","\n","I am hoping to team up with the AP computer science teacher. If she is teaching Python to all students, which I believe is the case, that would put me at a huge advantage and make my goal possible. Even so, I do not feel that my coding skills are up to scratch yet. This coming school year I will include some coding, and I will ramp up to more in the future.\n","\n","In any event, my students will be first year Honors Physics Juniors.
