It does not require a knowledge of how to code to begin, but an intro activity link is provided.  The prelab will allow students to use actual particle physics data and be taken step by step through a mostly provided code to create a histogram.  The idea is that students will come to the conclusion that where you see peaks in the histogram are the value we assign to whatever quantity we measure, but also allows them to see that depending on measurement methods and data collection can vary slightly (any student that has had statistic will probably love this)\n","\n","**Implementation**\n"," - Ideally this lab should take 3 days.\n","    - 1 day for the prelab\n","    - 1 day to collect and submit the student data to be compiled\n","    - 1 day to analyze the data and finish\n","\n","- The method of compiling data is up to the teacher.

This will update in real time and can allow students to work with not just other students or classes, but district wide if teachers at other schools use the same form to collect the data.\n","  - I'm sure there is a way to do Microsoft forms to excel but haven't figured it out yet."],"metadata":{"id":"I5UFsX2FFgwf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VxPAdfoTjv0X"},"source":["# Prelab - The Mass of a Muon\n","\n","The Prelab activity uses data from the [CMS detector](https://cms.cern/detector) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.
