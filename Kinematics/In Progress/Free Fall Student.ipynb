Either a (constant) velocity or a constant acceleration may be calculated from these measurements. This single experiment does not let the experimenter decide which model is correct.\n","\n","![Constant](https://www.millersville.edu/physics/experiments/013/fig14p1.gif)\n","\n","No matter which model is correct, the following is correct: **The distance fallen divided by the time of fall is equal to the average velocity.** If the velocity is constant, then the average velocity is also the instantaneous velocity. *If we drop from a larger height, the two models make two different predictions:* If the velocity is constant, we will measure the same average velocity as before. If the velocity is not constant (e.g., if the speed increases as the ball falls) then the average velocity will be different for the new drop height. For example, if the speed increases as the ball falls, the new average velocity will be larger because some larger velocities contribute to the new average.\n","\n","![Velocity](https://www.millersville.edu/physics/experiments/013/fig14p2.gif)\n","![Acceleration](https://www.millersville.edu/physics/experiments/013/fig14p3.gif)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"r7hoKkyI0MZE"},"source":["#Colab Jupyter Notebook Info\n","Click \"Copy to Drive\" (above &#8593;) or go to **File > Save a Copy in Drive** so you'll have your own version to work on.
