I would like to use a combination of computational like this one on energy as well as them gathering data from our various sensors and inporting them into a notebook and analyzing the data.  These will be used initially as elaborate activities until they get used to the coding (I have a mix of students with coding background and those with none).  Once they are comfortable using the noteboooks and coding basics then I would develop some activities as an engagement to begin a lesson with less to no scaffolding.  \n","\n","In addition to this I plan on using this for my Engineering Science students to complete their unit on Statistics instead of the spreadsheets that I have done in the past, which will allow me to increase the size of the data sets that they analyze."],"metadata":{"id":"AwaCJQ6JDp2a"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Kinetic Energy vs Potential Energy**"],"metadata":{"id":"9-Ax-wMVAHg9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["A 1000 g ball is being dropped from a 20.0 m height.
